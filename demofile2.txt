Claimant:
   Mr Szymon Sieja  
       
Respondent:
  Kovacs Group Limited  
 
HEARD AT:
   Cambridge: 13 June 2022 
 
BEFORE
:   Employment Judge Michell, Mr J Williams; Mr S Holford 
 
REPRESENTATION
:   For the Claimant:      No appearance or representation  
        For the Respondent:    Mr R Kovacs (director) 
 
 
 
 JUDGMENT 
 
Each the Claimant’s claims against the Respondent are dismissed. 
 
  
REASONS 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
1.  The claimant worked for a third party via the respondent as a warehouse operative 
between 13 May and 11 July 2020.  By an ET1 presented to the tribunal on 5 July 
2020, and following early conciliation, he brought various claims, including of direct 
race  discrimination/harassment  and  unlawful  deduction  of  wages.  A  preliminary 
hearing took place before Employment Judge Quill on 27 September 2021, where Mr 
 R Ryan (director/owner) appeared for the respondent and the claimant appeared in 
person.  The issues were refined, and clarified, and parts of the claim were dismissed

on withdrawal. The judge gave various directions to the parties, including preparation 
 of a bundle (by the claimant) and witness statements (by both parties). 
 
HEARING 
 
2.  Today was a remote hearing on the papers, which has not been objected to by the 
parties. The form of remote hearing was by CVP. A face to face hearing was not held 
 because  it  was  not  practicable  and  all  issues  could  be  determined  at  a  remote 
hearing.  
 
3.  The tribunal was not provided with either a hearing bundle or any witness statements. 
 This is because the parties had not prepared them. Mr Kovacs supplied us with a few 
 documents, but not the ones the parties had been ordered to provide. Indeed, Mr 
Kovacs told us he had not read the case management order of 27 September 2021.  
This was not helpful. 
 
4.  The claimant did not attend. He gave no notice to the tribunal of his non-attendance. 
Mr Kovacs was asked by us whether or not he knew anything about the claimant’s 
non-attendance. He said he had “no idea”. He told us that he had spoken with the 
claimant on the telephone about eight months ago, at which point the claimant had 
indicated that he was not intending on being at the final hearing. Mr Kovacs opined 
that the claimant had “gone home” (i.e. returned to Poland). Mr Kovacs provided the 
tribunal with a telephone number for the claimant. Attempts by the clerk to contact 
the claimant during the hearing using that number were not successful. 
 
5.  Accordingly, we considered the claim ought to be dismissed upon the non-attendance 
 of the claimant, it appearing to us that the claim was not being actively pursued by 
him and no reasons for his absence having been given. 
 
6.  For future reference, it might have been useful for the respondent to have attempted 
to make contact with the claimant during the last eight months, in order to ascertain  Case No: 3306375/2020 (CVP)

whether or not he wished to pursue the claim -and if so, what he intended to do about 
 compliance with the directions.
